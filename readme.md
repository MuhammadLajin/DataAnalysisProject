# Project: Communicate Data Finding(exams Dateset)
## by (Muhammad Lajin)


## Dataset
>There are 1,000 row in the dataset with 10 columns (gender, ethnicity, parental_level_of_education, lunch, test_preparation_course, math_score, reading_score, writing_score, percentage & grade).
Most variables are qualitative in nature, but the variables math_score, reading_score, writing_score, percentage are quantitavive in nature.
Variable grade is an ordered factor variable with the following levels:
(best) ——> (worst) grade: S, A, B, C, D, E, F


## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.

   <li><strong>gender</strong></li>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>Females</strong></li>
               <ul>
                   <li> female students performed better than male students in reading_score and writing_score</li>
                   <li>female students overall have done better than male students.</li>
                   <li>Outliers for female students below the minimum for math_score, reading_score and writing_score were more compared to male students.</li>
                   <li>female students scored more number of grade S, A and B </li>
               </ul>
           <li><strong>males</strong></li>
                <ul>
                   <li>math_score being the exception where male students performed better than female students</li>
                   <li>male students scored more number grade C, D and E </li>
                   <li>more number of female students failed the exam compared to male students, but this can also be the result of having sligtly more number of female students, compared to male students in the dataset as the difference isn't very drastic</li>                   
               </ul>
       </ul>
   
   <li><strong>test_preparation_course</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>No. of students who had none of the test preparation courses were significantly high among the least scorers.</li>
            <li>Students who completed test preparation are more having a S grade whereas the students who did none are more having B, C, D, E and F grade.</li>
            <li>Students with parents who have completed master's degree scored the best.</li>
            <li>Stuents with parents who have only completed high school had a comparitively low performance in terms of percentage.</li>
            <li>students who have completed the test preparation course have done way better than those who         haven't.
            </li>
            <li>Students with parents who have completed master's degree scored the best.</li>
        </ul>
